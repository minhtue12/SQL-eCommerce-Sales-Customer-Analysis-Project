# 🛒 SQL eCommerce Sales Analysis  

## 🎯 1️⃣ Mục tiêu Dự án  

Phân tích toàn diện hoạt động bán hàng của một **website thương mại điện tử**, bao gồm:  
- Hiểu **hành vi mua hàng của khách**  
- Đánh giá **hiệu suất sản phẩm**  
- Phân tích **doanh thu, lợi nhuận và đơn hàng theo thời gian**

## 🧱 2️⃣ Cấu trúc dữ liệu  

🔹 **Các bảng chính:**
- `customers` – Thông tin khách hàng  
- `products` – Thông tin sản phẩm  
- `orders` – Thông tin đơn hàng  
- `order_items` – Chi tiết từng sản phẩm trong đơn  

---

### 📊 Đếm số lượng bản ghi trong mỗi bảng
```sql
SELECT 'customers' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
UNION ALL
SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders
UNION ALL
SELECT 'order_items', COUNT(*) FROM order_items;
```

### 🔍 Kiểm tra giá trị NULL trong các bảng
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_customers 
FROM customers 
WHERE customer_id IS NULL OR customer_name IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_orders 
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_items 
FROM order_items 
WHERE product_id IS NULL OR quantity IS NULL;
```

### 🔸 Tổng quan doanh thu toàn hệ thống
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) AS total_customers,
    SUM(oi.total_price) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.total_price) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id;
```

### 🔸 Doanh thu theo tháng
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(o.order_date) AS year,
    MONTH(o.order_date) AS month,
    SUM(oi.total_price) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### 🔸 Top 10 sản phẩm bán chạy nhất
```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(oi.total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
```
```

### 🔸 Doanh thu theo danh mục sản phẩm
```sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    SUM(oi.total_price) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```


---
### 🔸 Tỷ lệ khách hàng quay lại (Repeat Rate)
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_count > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS repeat_customers,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN order_count > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS repeat_rate_pct
FROM (
    SELECT c.customer_id, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id
) t;
```
